        <h1>Monica M Raffaelli</h1>
        
        <p>Monica was born a polyglot, transformed her communication skills into community-building skills, realized social media wasn't quite her thing, and is finally pursuing the dream her practical and loving parents warned against: art. Her current tools include laser cutting machines, animation software, and pencils. She is currently a graduate student at New York University's School of Engineering.</p>
