        <p>There are apps for women to track their monthly cycles, their fertility, their health, and there are apps for men to track what they don't like about monthly cycles. These divisive apps are band-aids. They provide solutions to immediate problems, but do nothing about the bigger ones.
<br><br>
Are you the Don Juan who hates blood? The gal who keeps uterine woes to herself? The couple who just doesn't have time to plan around nature's inconveniences? The goal of SHVRK is to solve these types of problems in a simple, quirky and informative way.
<br><br>
Here's how it could be used:
<br><br>
For the Don Juan
<br>Search for each lady by typing in her number, sync your calendar with theirs, personalize your notifications settings, and you'll never be unpleasantly surprised again. Want a two-day heads up before SHVRK week? Want to be reminded that Carla likes chocolate and Nancy likes wine? After setting up your notifications, you never have to open the app again. You'll just get the notifications with facts about women, and of course, sharks. 
<br><br>
For the gal with secret uterine woes
<br>Allow your significant other(s) to sync calendar(s) with you. You can get your own notifications as many days in advance as you'd like. Always forget to pick up feminine products? Don't like chocolate unless it is that time? The app will let you know. 
<br><br>
For the couple who doesn't have time to plan around nature's inconveniences
<br>All of the above, and more. Maybe he blames PMS, or maybe you don't want to be bothered. Activate "Sweet Nothings" so that the app automatically sends your significant other personalized text messages, whether things are tense or not.</p>
